AB Electronics Python Libraries
=====

Python 2.x Libraries to work with Raspberry Pi expansion boards from http://www.abelectronics.co.uk

Python 2.x with smbus

These libraries have been updated to be formatted in PEP8 python formatting on 16 November 2014 and class and function names have been changed to meet the PEP8 styles.  Previous versions of the Python libraries can be found at https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/Archive

To download to your Raspberry Pi type in terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

##Helper class
We have now added ABE_helpers.py class to the libraries which use Puthon smbus to enable a single bus instance to be used with multiple expansion boards and to avoid smbus conflicts.
